<strong>1/ Creating and animating the "frightening trade market"</strong> a IRL voted list shared globally by millions of citizens enabling us to enlighten the worst societies, habits and brands in the world (ie : only a real action threatening brands can change their habits and their manner to communicate more than just a simple boycott)
</p>
<p>
<strong>2/ Every 15 - 30 days happen a new boycott, additional</strong> (the most popular, branded like #NOcocacolas #NOamazon...) + offline action (stores) and online (Social Media) are included in a list and built from all the fights spots and its network places in the world. The main goal : adding actions without erasing the previous ones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3/ All together : overcoming the votes in AG</strong> and having this belonging feeling to a community. Everyone is welcomed and can vote anonymously preserving its identity (not the V1 for practical reasons). People can decide to not vote but this one is recognized and valorised.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4/ Purposing Alternatives</strong>: More than just a boycott, we would prefer to brainstorm ideas AND vote for those which are the most popular. Excluding the brands yes! but with an alternative from the assembly (here we go, we are going to establish a real democracy)
</p>
<p>
<strong>5/ Towards a permanent campaign</strong>: boycott and mobilisations are the core of our actions (stores blockage, cyber-attacks etc...) several communication campaigns, organisations of events and press relations launching every new boycott
